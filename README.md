# Landing page design

![Design preview for the Loopstudios landing page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

This challenge focuses mostly on HTML & CSS. The mobile navigation toggle is actually programmable with CSS.

You are expected to use only plain HTML, CSS with the Bootstrap 5 Library.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to.

The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. This should help train your eye to perceive differences in spacings and sizes.

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.


## Submission
- Create a repo on gihub called ``stykite-bootstap-assessment``
- Push your project to the repo created
- Include a link to your live hosted project on your github readme.md file. For live hosting use any free hosting like netlify, surge etc

**Good luck!** ðŸš€
